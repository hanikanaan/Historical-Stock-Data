# Historical Stock Data Fetcher/Plotter Script

Using Yahoo Finance API via RapidAPI, this can be used to grab and write historical stock data into a .csv file, 
and also can be used to plot the data as a chart, as well as saving the chart in a hex representation and saving to 
a database. Someday (eventually) will be implemented to analyze and predict stock prices.
